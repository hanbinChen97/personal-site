# Intro

I am a Ph.D. graduate from [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/), specializing in Subsurface Engineering and Numerical Modeling. My research focuses on cyclic processes related to energy storage systems, with expertise in developing multi-physics constitutive models using the MOOSE Framework, HPC, FEM, Python, and C++.

Throughout my academic career, I've published papers on energy storage mechanisms and applications, and presented my work at international conferences such as the European Geosciences Union (EGU). I'm passionate about integrating numerical models into unified frameworks for real-time computation and analysis, optimizing algorithms, and quantifying subsurface instabilities and uncertainties.

# Professional Experience

My professional journey includes both academic research and practical experiences:

- As a Scientific Researcher at RWTH Aachen University (2021-2024), I conducted research on cyclic processes related to underground energy storage systems as part of a DFG-funded project.
- I published three significant papers on energy storage mechanisms and applications, including work on creep-fatigue behavior in sandstone and thermo-mechanical behavior of salt caverns for hydrogen storage.
- I've developed multi-physics constitutive models for rock mass behavior in MOOSE, leading calibration, validation, and optimization of design parameters to ensure stability in storage systems.
- Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a self-employed entrepreneur in Berlin (2017-2019), managing product procurement and sales operations.
- I also completed an internship in geo-mechanical engineering in Chongqing, China (2017), gaining practical field experience.

# Education

- I earned my Ph.D. in Subsurface Energy Engineering from RWTH Aachen University in 2024, with a dissertation on "Cyclic Processes related to Underground Energy Storage Systems."
- My Master's degree in Geo-engineering (2021) from RWTH Aachen University included a thesis on "Numerical Simulation of Hydro-Mechanical Coupled Processes around Tunnels in Opalinus Clay."
- I completed my Bachelor's degree in Geological Engineering at Chongqing Jiaotong University in 2017, with a thesis on "Landslide Management and Design Protection Project in Waxiang Village, China."
